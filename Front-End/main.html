        A programming language for Real Men. Most languages try to provide a simplified way to solve specific problems well. 
        C++ makes no such concession and tries to be mediocre at everything. 
        It lets you program at a very high level, and a very low level in the same program.
        It lets you write procedural code, object oriented code, generic code and mix them all up. 
        It makes you decide everything and provides no help if you get it wrong.
